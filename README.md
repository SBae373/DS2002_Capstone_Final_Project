# DS2002_Capstone_Final_Project

- In the "final_project" folder, you will find my .py file of the capstone project as well as .sql files of where I created and populated my databases as well as another folder called "data" which is split into two folders for my csv files and JSON files of my data. 

- This second data project builds upon what I did for the first project and further demonstrates my understanding and competence of what I learned about data science systems over the course of this semester.
